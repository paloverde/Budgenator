# budgenator

## A Simple Budget Calculator

This is a simple budget calculator done primarily as a learning and playground project.
The current version is under re-development using modern web technologies and I
plan to create an Electron and NativeScripts verson as well.

You can access the previous versions via the tags `v1` & `v2`, on GH Pages:
- Version 1 http://samuel-mccallum.github.io/budgenator/v1/
- Version 2 http://samuel-mccallum.github.io/budgenator/v2/
- Current http://samuel-mccallum.github.io/budgenator/v3/
