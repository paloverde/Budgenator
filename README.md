This is a code demo project that expands on a previous budget calculator demo.
It is still a work in progress at this point but it is mostly functional and
easy to use.

#### Main Features

- Ability to calculate a budget in two timeframes, for instance *week* and *month*
- Select from a variety of different budget templates in the top menu
- Create your own budget template with custom categories and timeframes

#### Basic Usage

Select the desired template from the top navigation dropdown and fill out any
field, the rest of the budget will auto-calulate.

#### Creating A New Budget Template

Choose the **new** option from the top navigation dropdown.

Here is an example for a Day/Month personal fitness:

- Choose new template
- Fill out the name: `Fitness`
- Fill out the glyphicon: `glyphicon-hear`
- Timeframe 'short': `Day`
- Timeframe 'long': 'Month'
- Timeframe 'ratio':  Say you workout 15 days a month, the ratio is then 15:1, or `15`
- Add categories such as:
 - Gym Membership
 - Protein Powder
 - Deoderant
 - Socks
- Click Save and calculate your budget!
